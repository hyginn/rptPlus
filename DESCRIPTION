Description: A template for an RStudio project of an R package with a GitHub
             repository that follows principles described in Hadley Wickham's
             R Packages book and is compatible with CRAN and Bioconductor
             guidelines and best practice for reproducible research. The project
             is version controlled, contains testing code, can be installed from
             GitHub using standard tools, contains sample NEWS and CITATION
             files, an MD5 file and utilities to create and update it, 
             an example data set, a compiled C++ function, a Vignette
             built from an R markdown source, a shiny app, and extensive
             instructions on how to install and customize.
