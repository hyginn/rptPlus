Description: A template for an RStudio project of an R package with a GitHub
             repository that follows principles described in Hadley Wickham's
             R Packages book and is compatible with CRAN and Bioconductor
             guidelines. The project is version controlled, contains testing
             code, can be installed from GitHub using standard tools, contains 
             sample NEWS and CITATION files, an example data set, a packaged
             closure, a compiled C++ function, a shiny function, and extensive
             instructions on how to install and customize.
